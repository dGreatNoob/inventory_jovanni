## Technical Implementation Details

### Dashboard Statistics Method Pattern
Each Livewire component now includes a `getDashboardStatsProperty()` method that returns an array of statistics with the following structure:
```php
[
    'label' => 'Metric Name',
    'value' => 'Display Value', 
    'icon' => '<svg>...</svg>',
    'gradient' => 'from-color-500 to-color-600',
    'change' => percentage_change, // optional
    'period' => 'comparison period' // optional
]
```

### Database Queries
- Used efficient aggregate queries (COUNT, SUM) for calculations
- Implemented month-over-month comparisons using `whereMonth()` and `whereYear()`
- Utilized Laravel Eloquent relationships where appropriate

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with responsive grid layouts
- Cards stack vertically on small screens, spread horizontally on larger screens
- Proper spacing and typography scaling

### Performance Considerations
- Statistics are calculated using efficient database queries
- Computed properties cache results during request lifecycle
- Minimal additional database overhead

## Visual Design Features

### Color Gradients
Each statistic card uses distinct gradient colors:
- **Blue:** Primary metrics (totals, counts)
- **Yellow:** Pending/warning states
- **Green:** Positive/completed states
- **Red:** Critical/expense metrics
- **Purple:** Value/specialized metrics
- **Indigo:** Growth/analytical metrics

### Icons
- Used Heroicons (outline style) for consistency
- Each statistic has a relevant icon (documents, clock, check, warning, etc.)
- Icons scale appropriately and maintain proper contrast

### Change Indicators
- Up/down arrows for positive/negative changes
- Percentage displays with proper formatting
- Color coding for positive (green) vs negative (red) trends

## Usage Examples

### Basic Dashboard
```blade
<x-section-dashboard 
    title="My Dashboard" 
    :stats="$dashboardStats"
/>
```

### Dashboard with Actions
```blade
<x-section-dashboard 
    title="Advanced Dashboard" 
    :stats="$dashboardStats"
    :actions="[
        [
            'label' => 'Export',
            'icon' => '<svg>...</svg>',
            'class' => 'text-white bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700',
            'click' => 'exportData()'
        ]
    ]"
/>
```
