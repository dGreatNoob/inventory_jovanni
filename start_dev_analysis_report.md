# Start-Dev Script Analysis Report

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Repository:** inventory_jovanni  
**Branch:** dev  

## Executive Summary

The `start-dev.sh` script was executed successfully and the Laravel application is running on http://localhost:8000. However, several non-critical errors were detected during the startup process.

---

## Application Status

### ✅ Running Services

- **Laravel Application**: Running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
- **MySQL Database**: Running on localhost:3307 (Docker container)
- **Redis**: Running on localhost:6380 (Docker container)
- **phpMyAdmin**: Running on http://localhost:8081

### ⚠️ Issues Detected

#### 1. PHP Redis Extension Error
**Error:**
```
PHP Warning: PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'redis' 
(tried: /usr/lib/php/modules/redis (/usr/lib/php/modules/redis: 
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory), 
/usr/lib/php/modules/redis.so (/usr/lib/php/modules/redis.so: 
undefined symbol: igbinary_serialize))
```

**Impact:** Minor - Redis extension not loading properly  
**Root Cause:** Missing or incompatible Redis PHP extension  
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Install igbinary extension required by Redis
sudo pacman -S php-igbinary

# Or disable Redis if not needed in .env
CACHE_STORE=database
```

#### 2. Storage Logs Permission Error
**Error:**
```
There is no existing directory at "/var/www/storage/logs" 
and it could not be created: Permission denied
```

**Impact:** Low - Path seems to be looking for /var/www but app is in /home  
**Root Cause:** The error path refers to `/var/www` while the application is at `/home/biiieem/repos/inventory_jovanni`  
**Status:** Storage/logs directory exists and has proper permissions (owned by http:http)  
**Note:** This error appears to be a false alarm or historical error

#### 3. Docker Compose Version Warning
**Warning:**
```
level=warning msg="/home/biiieem/repos/inventory_jovanni/docker-compose.yml: 
the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored"
```

**Impact:** None - informational only  
**Solution:** Remove the `version: '3.8'` line from docker-compose.yml

## Database Analysis

### Database Connection
- **Host:** 127.0.0.1
- **Port:** 3307
- **Database:** inventory_jovanni
- **Username:** jovanni

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Redis Extension (Optional)
If Redis caching is needed:
```bash
sudo pacman -S php-igbinary php-redis
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
```

### 2. Update Docker Compose
Remove the obsolete version attribute:
```yaml
# Remove this line:
version: '3.8'
```

### 3. Fix Department Seeder
Update `database/seeders/DepartmentSeeder.php` to handle duplicates:
```php
Department::firstOrCreate(
    ['name' => 'Admin Department'],
    ['description' => '...']
);
```

### 4. Environment-Specific Logging
Consider updating log paths to not reference /var/www when running from /home

### 5. Add Health Checks
The script already has basic health checks for MySQL and Redis, which is good.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Application is running successfully
2. Access the application at http://localhost:8000
3. Optional: Fix Redis extension if caching is needed
4. Optional: Fix DepartmentSeeder to prevent duplicate errors

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start services (already running)
docker compose up -d

# Access application
http://localhost:8000

# Access database admin
http://localhost:8081

# View logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

---

## Success Indicators

✅ Docker containers started successfully  
✅ MySQL health check passed  
✅ Redis health check passed  
✅ Laravel application server running  
✅ No critical errors blocking application  
⚠️ Minor non-critical warnings present  
⚠️ Database seeder has duplicate entry issue  

---

## Conclusion

The `start-dev.sh` script executed successfully and the application is operational. The detected issues are minor and do not prevent the application from running. The warnings about Redis extension and the /var/www path are non-critical and can be addressed if needed.

The application appears to be a comprehensive inventory management system for "Jovanni Bags" with features for product management, sales operations, branch management, and more.
